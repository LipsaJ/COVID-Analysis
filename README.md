# COVID-Analysis
Analysis Goals:
I am doing sentiment analysis of tweets related to vaccines over a year from Feb-2020 to Feb-2021.
The objectives and research questions that I hope to answer through this approach are: 
Goal 1: Find out how many tweets sentiments changed regarding the covid vaccine for 2020 and current months in 2021 (January - February). 
Goal 2: Monitor how the sentiments changes on important weeks - for example: 
* when Pfizer / Moderna released the vaccines phase I/II outcome.
* when Pfizer / Moderna released the vaccines phase III outcome.
* During USA election week
* During the USA President's inauguration week.

Steps:
Step 1:
Collected data from twitter- my search terms are: - "Vaccine OR vaccine against coronavirus OR Vaccines work OR Covid Vaccine OR #vaccine2021"
Step 2:
Data cleaning: Cleaned the tweets - remove @ and other Twitter related symbols.
Step 3:
Sentiment analysis: Used Vader for sentiment analysis.
Step 4:
Sentiment analysis: Plot the sentiment for a year.
